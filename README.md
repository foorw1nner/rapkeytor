# rapKeytor

rapKeytor is a fast and lightweight API key hunter.
It scans JavaScript files and other plaintext sources for API keys in multiple formats â€” including hardcoded variables, object properties, headers, and embedded URLs.
Beyond typical keys, it also detects:

- Basic authorization tokens

- Bearer tokens

- JWTs (JSON Web Tokens)

Use it to automate the discovery of sensitive tokens that may have been exposed through client-side code or misconfigured applications.

ðŸ¦– Track. Hunt. Leak. With rapKeytor.
